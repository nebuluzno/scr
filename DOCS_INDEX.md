## Documentation Cleanup Rules (Adopted)

1. Single-source ownership
- Keep each topic primarily in one file; link instead of duplicating long sections.

2. Stable progression
- `README` for overview, `QUICKSTART` for first run, `TUTORIALS` for depth.

3. Config consistency
- Every new config key must be documented in `README` and, when operationally relevant, in `QUICKSTART`.

4. Release alignment
- Version strings, release notes, and checklist targets must be updated together.

5. Future work isolation
- Keep upcoming ideas only in `FUTURE_TODO.md`; keep `SCR_Improvements.md` focused on delivered history.
